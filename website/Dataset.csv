Additionally, the clear weaves of clothing avoid the ultraviolet radiation of the sun and the burns in the skin, protecting it, therefore, from the heat. Finally, more impermeable weaves protect the human body from coming into contact with the water of rain or snow.

The organic matter does two things for our soil. It adds water holding capacity and nutrient holding capacity. You can envision this process by comparing organic matter to a sponge. Of course, there is a limit to how much of the organic matter you can introduce to soil. If there is too much of it, in addition to supplying plants with too much nutrients it will start oxidizing, which provides an additional supply of nutrients."
