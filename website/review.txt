A Kindle First selection that is masterfully written with complex characters and heart-pounding scenes.  It takes place in Italy -'the forgotten front'- during WW II and the reader is drawn into a web of intrigue.  Pino Lello, 17 years of age, is wise beyond his years and intelligent, as well.  It is a gripping story of resilience, the indomitable spirit of a young man that knew no boundaries and courage that sustained him during dark hours.When reading the first portion, I was wondering if (and how) this intense pace would continue.  The climbing scenes through the mountains gave me a real shot of adrenaline.  I felt as though I was one of the climbers and not a reader.  This is also when the echoes of 'Nessun Dorma' were played with such passion.  For me, this is one of the underlying themes in the story - 'none shall sleep'.  And, Pino Lello has taken that to heart for the remainder of this story.The action intensified throughout the remainder of the book, and one is allowed a rare glimpse into the mind of Il Duce  - Benito Mussolini - plus the inner workings of the German High Command.  Becoming a driver for Major General Hans Leyer allows Pino access to a man that is two steps from the Fuhrer.  Pino Lello witnesses atrocities he wishes he could forget but keeps soldiering olved.
