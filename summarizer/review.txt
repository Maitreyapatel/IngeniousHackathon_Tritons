Heads-up - this is a lengthy review - but when you are considering a headphone at this price you deserve as much review as you can get to help you decide! I will rate by topic so you can also focus on what is most important to you. Let's start with context. These are my first Beats headphones - wired or wireless. They are not of course my first wireless or wired headphones. I have several wireless headphones including Jabra Move and Jaybird BlueBuds X. I also have several wired headphones with my favorites being KEF M500 (on ear) and Oppo PM-2 (over ear). My sound preference in a headphone is crisp and clear highs and mids with a presence and "definition" of bass - but not over done. Yea, I'm not a bass-head. So here we go...WIRELESS (5 / 5):Right off the bat, this is where these headphone excel, and why I considered and bought them in the first place. They are by far the easiest bluetooth headphones I have used to pair and manage with multiple devices. This of course assumes you are very deep in the Apple eco-system - which I am. I use these headphones with an iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Initial pairing was simple and automatic with my iPhone - place it next to it, turned it on, hit accept and done. Then in seconds the headphone showed up in all my Apple devices! And switching between what device is connected and active is just as easy. I could never get previous wireless headphones I owned to play nice with multiple devices even though they supposedly supported this feature. One wireless headphone always went back and forth between my iPhone and iPad even when I was in the middle of listening to music on my iPhone. Not so with the Solo3! And the range and battery life are incredible. I have owned my Solo3 for over a week and I am still on the initial charge. So hands down wireless performance is the best feature of these headphones.COMFORT (4 / 5):The Solo3 is an on-ear headphone and for me they are actually quite comfortable. The leather pads are comfortable and seal well - though they are not as soft as the pads on my KEFs. But maybe they will soften over time. The "clamping" of the Solo3 is firm and keeps the headphones very stable during moderate activity but not so tight that they bother my ears at all. The headband liner is comfortable for me too - I don't seem to have the rubbing problem some people have mentioned. And the plastic construction (see again under quality) actually has one plus in that it keeps the headphones light. I almost don't notice they are on my head until... The good seal and firm/thick pads cause my ears to heat up after about 30 mins so I do have to take them off for short "cool-down" breaks.QUALITY (3 / 5):This is a hard one to judge short term so my rating here is certainly preliminary. Bottom line - admittedly there is a lot of plastic here. Yes, it is a plus under comfort as it keeps the headphones light. But when you get in to this price range you defiantly see more metals and leathers and less plastic. And some wired headphones I have are so solid they have lasted me over a decade! I am not sure I will be able to say that about these headphones. And a 1 year warranty is not very confident - some headphones starting at this price point offer up to 3 years. It would certainly inspire confidence if Beats backed these a bit more and made me feel like the plastic construction was solid and truly there for comfort (weight). That said its too early to bash longevity yet.SOUND (4 / 5):Ok now the final and most subjective topic - the sound quality. Recall my sound preference - not a bass-head. When I first heard about these headphones with the new wireless chip - I was interested because of all the hassles I had before with bluetooth headphones. But because they were Beats I struggled to decide to purchase or not. I have not owned Beats because Beats headphones I listened to in the past were definitely too much bass for me - thudding and muffled. But I decided to give it a try - I could always return them. They are not going back! The sound is actually a pleasant surprise. Yes, they are more bass then what I own now - but they sound more balanced then what I remember. You can hear good mids and highs - though they are certainly more reserved. And the spatial separation is very good - these give a full and well spaced sound that makes you feel like you are indeed in the middle of the studio or concert. They excel with more Rock then Classical, so there still is a place for my wired headphones, but I also don't feel like I have to sacrifice sound quality to get wireless convenience.OVERALL (4 / 5):Overall, these are very good wireless headphones - they are now my primary go to wireless headphones for sound quality and convenience across all my Apple devices - though I am keeping my set of wireless Jaybirds for intense workouts only. They are even what I turn to now over my wired headphones for most music/podcasts unless I want to immerse myself in some Acoustic, Classical or Jazz where I still prefer my wired options. Value is good - plastic to price ratio is not ideal - but it is offset by the wireless simplicity and sound. If you want a no-compromise wireless experience, you should at least consider these headphones. Great pair of Headphones!  I really love the quality of the bass and acoustics. I previously owned a pair of beats solo 2 wireless and I was very intrigued to check these out! I bought a pair from best buy for $299 (A bit expensive) and that is the only reason I did not give these 5 stars. If the price was $199 I would have given them 6 stars. The beats solo2 sound Exactly the same as these. The only difference between these and the beats solo2 is with these you get 40 hours of battery play time. THAT IS INSANE! you can basically listen to music on and off for 2 weeks without a charge. Also if these die you can fast charge them for 5 minutes and get 2 to 3 hours of play time. The Bluetooth connectivity is very simple with apple products. As soon as I turned the headphones on I was prompted with a message on my iphone asking If I would like to connect to the Solo3. Very cool. Also You can travel 300 feet away from your cell phone while wearing these and the music will not break up. That is much further than any other Bluetooth device is currently capable. Most devices allow you to get 30 ft away. So if you would prefer to charge your headphones a lot less and walk further away from your cellphone while wearing these. GO with these! if you don't mind charging the headphones every few days and you don't plan on getting too far from your phone. Get the Beats solo2 wireless. Sound quality and music experience will be EXACTLY the SAME!I bought these with my own money from best buy and this is not a sponsored or paid review! I made a full detailed video for anyone unsure of whether or not to make the jump! Hope this helps!

The Solo 3's changes all that....With High Quality Output Sound, Long Lasting Battery Life, and made of Great Quality materials you have everything you need in the box and the HeadPhones already come with a full charge ..... I gotta be completely Honest and say I have had them for half a day at the time of this review and wanted to write an informative review on my experience .... the quality of hd sound and battery life for daily use ... some up in One word AMAZING!!!....40 hours of battery life after a single charge or 3 hours after a 5 min. charge ...Great Quality Sound and what looks to be made of great lasting material ....

I like the head phones not to mention how quickly it connects to your iPhone , now I also own an Apple Watch and was always pleased on the seamless experience of the bluetooth connectivity ...the Solo 3's give you the same experience ... giving cordless a new meaning.....Update;After almost 6 months of Normal Use Left Headphone gave up ( no sound) Lets see if we are covered ..... I can not believe how bad these are. Let me clarify I love beats I have my own. I was buying these for my girlfriend for the holidays and what I received is just disrespectful as far as I’m concerned. I attached photos showing the junk I just received in the mail and compare it to mine. I’ve never been so upset with a purchase on amazon before. UNBELIEVABLE.LOVE LOVE LOVE!! These are my first pair and they sound good and look good. Happy early birthday to me!!Disclaimer: I've never owned a pair of headphones in this price range.  I bought these on sale ($30 off) and had a bunch of rewards for the store I purchased these at - so I honestly paid about $30 out of pocket.I love these things.  First, I was looking for something with the W1 chip to easily sync/switch between my iPhone, apple watch, ipod, ipad, etc.  It's flawless.  I also have them synced to my Windows 10 laptop.  If that's on it takes priority over the other connections, so I just flip the bluetooth on the laptop on or off (it's a toggle function button on mine) and it works great for that as well.  This alone is awesome for my use.I find them very comfortable.  I have a big head lol, not much hair to worry about though ;)  I heard some people didn't like the padding on the top, but I think it's adequate and doesn't bother me at all.Now, like I said above - I haven't had much to compare to in this price range.  This blows away any other pair of headphones I've used.  I have some sony over the ear headphones (plug in), some jaybird x2's, I've had some power beats... These sound so good to me.  The bass is strong on music it's supposed to be, and seems to be perfect on other music, country, rock, etc.  I know beats reputation for overpowering bass, and I just don't hear it here.  I'm no audiophile though.The battery life is just ridiculous.  40 hours?  I've played about 20 hours of music since last charge and am just above 50% battery.  That is crazy.The wireless range IS INSANE.  I can leave my phone in the bedroom, be across the house (75ft+) though 3 interior walls and an exterior wall, and these don't skip a beat.  They can also be plugged in, includes a 3.5MM cable with remote.They work great for making calls and talking to siri as well!If anything changes I'll post it, but honestly I'm blown away by these.I ordered these headphones on March 11th I got them about two weeks later. They were great for about a month and a half. However, for the last week only one side is working.I bought these for my boyfriend as a surprise and he absolutely loves them. I ordered the black matte color so I didn't have to worry about fingerprints and they look really slick and expensive. The sound is amazing (work out/life-changing) and they last a good amount of time - at least 3-4 days so far without having to recharge. They come with a neat little bag to carry them in that's compact and portable. Definitely worth the money, you won't regret this purchase trust me.These are REAL BEATS, if anyone is wondering if your getting scammed or not. I am so pleased. They are BRAND NEW. I got the rose gold color and they match my phone!!! Btw, I think they are extremely comfertable. I've had them on all day, not one annoying thing about them. Plus the wireless is so cool it's tripping me out when I put my phone down into my purse and don't have to worry about wires!!WOW! Out of this world sound! What have I been missing all these years without BEATS? I've been so cheap and only buy affordable Skull Candy headphones. I am 101% happy with my purchase, they feel comfortable and sound awesome!Heads-up - this is a lengthy review - but when you are considering a headphone at this price you deserve as much review as you can get to help you decide!

This blows away any other pair of headphones I've used.  I have some sony over the ear headphones (plug in), some jaybird x2's, I've had some power beats... These sound so good to me.  The bass is strong on music it's supposed to be, and seems to be perfect on other music, country, rock, etc.  I know beats reputation for overpowering bass, and I just don't hear it here.  I'm no audiophile though.The battery life is just ridiculous.  40 hours?  I've played about 20 hours of music since last charge and am just above 50% battery.  That is crazy.The wireless range IS INSANE.  I can leave my phone in the bedroom, be across the house (75ft+) though 3 interior walls and an exterior wall, and these don't skip a beat.  They can also be plugged in, includes a 3.5MM cable with remote.They work great for making calls and talking to siri as well!If anything changes I'll post it, but honestly I'm blown away by these.I ordered these headphones on March 11th I got them about two weeks later. They were great for about a month and a half. However, for the last week only one side is working.I bought these for my boyfriend as a surprise and he absolutely loves them. I ordered the black matte color so I didn't have to worry about fingerprints and they look really slick and expensive. The sound is amazing (work out/life-changing) and they last a good amount of time - at least 3-4 days so far without having to recharge. They come with a neat little bag to carry them in that's compact and portable. Definitely worth the money, you won't regret this purchase trust me.These are REAL BEATS, if anyone is wondering if your getting scammed or not. I am so pleased. They are BRAND NEW. I got the rose gold color and they match my phone!!! Btw, I think they are extremely comfertable. I've had them on all day, not one annoying thing about them. Plus the wireless is so cool it's tripping me out when I put my phone down into my purse and don't have to worry about wires!!WOW! Out of this world sound! What have I been missing all these years without BEATS? I've been so cheap and only buy affordable Skull Candy headphones. I am 101% happy with my purchase, they feel comfortable and sound awesome!Heads-up - this is a lengthy review - but when you are considering a headphone at this price you deserve as much review as you can get to help you decide! I will rate by topic so you can also focus on what is most important to you. Let's start with context. These are my first Beats headphones - wired or wireless. They are not of course my first wireless or wired headphones. I have several wireless headphones including Jabra Move and Jaybird BlueBuds X. I also have several wired headphones with my favorites being KEF M500 (on ear) and Oppo PM-2 (over ear). My sound preference in a headphone is crisp and clear highs and mids with a presence and "definition" of bass - but not over done. Yea, I'm not a bass-head. So here we go...WIRELESS (5 / 5):Right off the bat, this is where these headphone excel, and why I considered and bought them in the first place. They are by far the easiest bluetooth headphones I have used to pair and manage with multiple devices. This of course assumes you are very deep in the Apple eco-system - which I am. I use these headphones with an iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Initial pairing was simple and automatic with my iPhone - place it next to it, turned it on, hit accept and done. Then in seconds the headphone showed up in all my Apple devices! And switching between what device is connected and active is just as easy. I could never get previous wireless headphones I owned to play nice with multiple devices even though they supposedly supported this feature. One wireless headphone always went back and forth between my iPhone and iPad even when I was in the middle of listening to music on my iPhone. Not so with the Solo3! And the range and battery life are incredible. I have owned my Solo3 for over a week and I am still on the initial charge. So hands down wireless performance is the best feature of these headphones.COMFORT (4 / 5):The Solo3 is an on-ear headphone and for me they are actually quite comfortable. The leather pads are comfortable and seal well - though they are not as soft as the pads on my KEFs. But maybe they will soften over time. The "clamping" of the Solo3 is firm and keeps the headphones very stable during moderate activity but not so tight that they bother my ears at all. The headband liner is comfortable for me too - I don't seem to have the rubbing problem some people have mentioned. And the plastic construction (see again under quality) actually has one plus in that it keeps the headphones light. I almost don't notice they are on my head until... The good seal and firm/thick pads cause my ears to heat up after about 30 mins so I do have to take them off for short "cool-down" breaks.QUALITY (3 / 5):This is a hard one to judge short term so my rating here is certainly preliminary. Bottom line - admittedly there is a lot of plastic here. Yes, it is a plus under comfort as it keeps the headphones light. But when you get in to this price range you defiantly see more metals and leathers and less plastic. And some wired headphones I have are so solid they have lasted me over a decade! I am not sure I will be able to say that about these headphones. And a 1 year warranty is not very confident - some headphones starting at this price point offer up to 3 years. It would certainly inspire confidence if Beats backed these a bit more and made me feel like the plastic construction was solid and truly there for comfort (weight). That said its too early to bash longevity yet.SOUND (4 / 5):Ok now the final and most subjective topic - the sound quality. Recall my sound preference - not a bass-head. When I first heard about these headphones with the new wireless chip - I was interested because of all the hassles I had before with bluetooth headphones. But because they were Beats I struggled to decide to purchase or not. I have not owned Beats because Beats headphones I listened to in the past were definitely too much bass for me - thudding and muffled. But I decided to give it a try - I could always return them. They are not going back! The sound is actually a pleasant surprise. Yes, they are more bass then what I own now - but they sound more balanced then what I remember. You can hear good mids and highs - though they are certainly more reserved. And the spatial separation is very good - these give a full and well spaced sound that makes you feel like you are indeed in the middle of the studio or concert. They excel with more Rock then Classical, so there still is a place for my wired headphones, but I also don't feel like I have to sacrifice sound quality to get wireless convenience.OVERALL (4 / 5):Overall, these are very good wireless headphones - they are now my primary go to wireless headphones for sound quality and convenience across all my Apple devices - though I am keeping my set of wireless Jaybirds for intense workouts only. They are even what I turn to now over my wired headphones for most music/podcasts unless I want to immerse myself in some Acoustic, Classical or Jazz where I still prefer my wired options. Value is good - plastic to price ratio is not ideal - but it is offset by the wireless simplicity and sound. If you want a no-compromise wireless experience, you should at least consider these headphones. Great pair of Headphones!  I really love the quality of the bass and acoustics. I previously owned a pair of beats solo 2 wireless and I was very intrigued to check these out! I bought a pair from best buy for $299 (A bit expensive) and that is the only reason I did not give these 5 stars. If the price was $199 I would have given them 6 stars. The beats solo2 sound Exactly the same as these. The only difference between these and the beats solo2 is with these you get 40 hours of battery play time. THAT IS INSANE! you can basically listen to music on and off for 2 weeks without a charge. Also if these die you can fast charge them for 5 minutes and get 2 to 3 hours of play time. The Bluetooth connectivity is very simple with apple products. As soon as I turned the headphones on I was prompted with a message on my iphone asking If I would like to connect to the Solo3. Very cool. Also You can travel 300 feet away from your cell phone while wearing these and the music will not break up. That is much further than any other Bluetooth device is currently capable. Most devices allow you to get 30 ft away. So if you would prefer to charge your headphones a lot less and walk further away from your cellphone while wearing these. GO with these! if you don't mind charging the headphones every few days and you don't plan on getting too far from your phone. Get the Beats solo2 wireless. Sound quality and music experience will be EXACTLY the SAME!I bought these with my own money from best buy and this is not a sponsored or paid review! I made a full detailed video for anyone unsure of whether or not to make the jump! Hope this helps! CheersLadies & Gents this Review is best suited for those share the same interest in the following questions.1) Is it Loud Enough?Absolutely...., Beats by Dre now uses Apple Tech in their HeadPhone lines, held by Strong Standards giving you quality sound and durability......Read On-->2) is It Worth the money ?You pay for what you expect not for what you want... ,  They are Made for the Every Day User with Great Quality Materials and of Course Performance3)Gloss Black Vs Black?These are GlossBlack with look great they really are made of good materials and although it has a beautiful glossy black finish to it , its not that annoying super shiny 'sprinkling gloss'I owned the previous model the Wired Solo 2's wich I did Enjoined but didn't fill my expectations on Quality ... The Solo 3's changes all that....With High Quality Output Sound, Long Lasting Battery Life, and made of Great Quality materials you have everything you need in the box and the HeadPhones already come with a full charge ..... I gotta be completely Honest and say I have had them for half a day at the time of this review and wanted to write an informative review on my experience .... the quality of hd sound and battery life for daily use ... some up in One word AMAZING!!!....40 hours of battery life after a single charge or 3 hours after a 5 min. charge ...Great Quality Sound and what looks to be made of great lasting material .... Get!! I like the head phones not to mention how quickly it connects to your iPhone , now I also own an Apple Watch and was always pleased on the seamless experience of the bluetooth connectivity ...the Solo 3's give you the same experience ... giving cordless a new meaning.....Update;After almost 6 months of Normal Use Left Headphone gave up ( no sound) Lets see if we are covered ..... I can not believe how bad these are. Let me clarify I love beats I have my own. I was buying these for my girlfriend for the holidays and what I received is just disrespectful as far as I’m concerned. I attached photos showing the junk I just received in the mail and compare it to mine. I’ve never been so upset with a purchase on amazon before. UNBELIEVABLE.LOVE LOVE LOVE!! These are my first pair and they sound good and look good. Happy early birthday to me!!Disclaimer: I've never owned a pair of headphones in this price range.  I bought these on sale ($30 off) and had a bunch of rewards for the store I purchased these at - so I honestly paid about $30 out of pocket.I love these things.  First, I was looking for something with the W1 chip to easily sync/switch between my iPhone, apple watch, ipod, ipad, etc.  It's flawless.  I also have them synced to my Windows 10 laptop.  If that's on it takes priority over the other connections, so I just flip the bluetooth on the laptop on or off (it's a toggle function button on mine) and it works great for that as well.

CheersLadies & Gents this Review is best suited for those share the same interest in the following questions.1) Is it Loud Enough?Absolutely...., Beats by Dre now uses Apple Tech in their HeadPhone lines, held by Strong Standards giving you quality sound and durability......Read On-->2) is It Worth the money ?You pay for what you expect not for what you want... ,  They are Made for the Every Day User with Great Quality Materials and of Course Performance3)Gloss Black Vs Black?These are GlossBlack with look great they really are made of good materials and although it has a beautiful glossy black finish to it , its not that annoying super shiny 'sprinkling gloss'I owned the previous model the Wired Solo 2's wich I did Enjoined but didn't fill my expectations on Quality ...

Let me clarify I love beats I have my own. I was buying these for my girlfriend for the holidays and what I received is just disrespectful as far as I’m concerned. I attached photos showing the junk I just received in the mail and compare it to mine. I’ve never been so upset with a purchase on amazon before. UNBELIEVABLE.LOVE LOVE LOVE!! These are my first pair and they sound good and look good. Happy early birthday to me!!Disclaimer: I've never owned a pair of headphones in this price range.  I bought these on sale ($30 off) and had a bunch of rewards for the store I purchased these at - so I honestly paid about $30 out of pocket.I love these things.  First, I was looking for something with the W1 chip to easily sync/switch between my iPhone, apple watch, ipod, ipad, etc.  It's flawless.  I also have them synced to my Windows 10 laptop.  If that's on it takes priority over the other connections, so I just flip the bluetooth on the laptop on or off (it's a toggle function button on mine) and it works great for that as well.  This alone is awesome for my use.I find them very comfortable.  I have a big head lol, not much hair to worry about though ;)  I heard some people didn't like the padding on the top, but I think it's adequate and doesn't bother me at all.Now, like I said above - I haven't had much to compare to in this price range.  This blows away any other pair of headphones I've used.  I have some sony over the ear headphones (plug in), some jaybird x2's, I've had some power beats... These sound so good to me.  The bass is strong on music it's supposed to be, and seems to be perfect on other music, country, rock, etc.  I know beats reputation for overpowering bass, and I just don't hear it here.  I'm no audiophile though.The battery life is just ridiculous.  40 hours?  I've played about 20 hours of music since last charge and am just above 50% battery.  That is crazy.The wireless range IS INSANE.  I can leave my phone in the bedroom, be across the house (75ft+) though 3 interior walls and an exterior wall, and these don't skip a beat.  They can also be plugged in, includes a 3.5MM cable with remote.They work great for making calls and talking to siri as well!If anything changes I'll post it, but honestly I'm blown away by these.I ordered these headphones on March 11th I got them about two weeks later. They were great for about a month and a half. However, for the last week only one side is working.I bought these for my boyfriend as a surprise and he absolutely loves them. I ordered the black matte color so I didn't have to worry about fingerprints and they look really slick and expensive. The sound is amazing (work out/life-changing) and they last a good amount of time - at least 3-4 days so far without having to recharge. They come with a neat little bag to carry them in that's compact and portable. Definitely worth the money, you won't regret this purchase trust me.These are REAL BEATS, if anyone is wondering if your getting scammed or not. I am so pleased. They are BRAND NEW. I got the rose gold color and they match my phone!!! Btw, I think they are extremely comfertable. I've had them on all day, not one annoying thing about them. Plus the wireless is so cool it's tripping me out when I put my phone down into my purse and don't have to worry about wires!!WOW! Out of this world sound! What have I been missing all these years without BEATS? I've been so cheap and only buy affordable Skull Candy headphones. I am 101% happy with my purchase, they feel comfortable and sound awesome!
